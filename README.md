## For doing this project:

Issue: This post is regarding the drop down boxes, they currently are fixed in place. I would like it so they are directly under each other, and then when you click expand on one the other is pushed down. How would i go about doing this?

Setup: Each box is its own div (box1 through to box6), and this is in two divs (top and bottom (for the corresponding row), this is then inside an about div.

CSS: This is the CSS I used: http://test.getfamo.us/css/screen.css

Im fairly certain there should be a way to do it with less code as well. But anyway Im more worried about having it so the box below moves down when the box expands. The code in question is under "/* ABOUT */" so if you search for that it should come up.

Thanks very much for any help offered! (expand coded in jquery if relevant)
